# Sanctify

Sanctify is a lightweight Jenkins alternative relying on simple command line
tools. Ability put job descriptions under version control is an inherent design
decision, not an afterthought.

## Design goals

* Job descriptions are simple scripts, written in any language
* Do not reinvent the wheel: leave time-based job triggering to cron for example
* Keep everything as simple as possible
